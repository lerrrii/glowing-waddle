# AIOStreams

AIOStreams consolidates multiple Stremio addons and debrid services into a single, easily configurable addon. It allows highly customizable filtering, sorting, and formatting of results, and supports proxying all your streams through MediaFlow Proxy or StremThru for enhanced compatibility and IP restriction bypass.

## Features

- **Unified Interface**: Aggregate results from various addons into a single, streamlined list.
- **Advanced Filtering**: By resolution, quality, visual/audio tags, keywords, and custom regex patterns.
- **Sophisticated Sorting**: Prioritize by quality, size, cached status, seeders, and custom regex rules.
- **Proxy Integration**: Route streams through MediaFlow or StremThru for IP bypass and improved playback.
- **Extensive Limits & Controls**: Set caps on addons, filters, regex patterns, file sizes, and timeouts.
- **Comprehensive Addon Support**: Out-of-the-box configs for Torrentio, MediaFusion, Comet, Jackettio, Stremio-Jackett, StremThru Store, Easynews, Easynews++, Debridio, Peerflix, DMM Cast, Orion, Torbox, and more.

> **Note:** All environment variables are configurable via the Runtipi UI. Deploy then visit `/configure` to tune settings.
